Designing software that controls and monitors a rocket isn’t something you find in typical coursework, and every line of code we wrote carried the weight of months of planning, countless testing sessions, and, of course, the pressure of launching Canada’s first liquid engine rocket. But seeing ‘Borealis’ reach an altitude of 5,855 meters (19,212 feet) and hit a top speed of 1646 km/h made every late night and every obstacle worth it.<br><br></p><h2 id="from-idea-to-launch-pad-a-team-effort">From Idea to Launch Pad: A Team Effort</h2><p>When we set out to build ‘Borealis,’ the stakes were high. We were venturing into uncharted territory, developing a liquid bi-propellant rocket powered by ethanol and nitrous oxide—a complex system that required precision and careful coordination across multiple sub-teams. As a team, we had to perfect everything from fluid dynamics and combustion to structural integrity and flight control. Our software had to be as resilient as the physical rocket itself, ready to handle anything the flight might throw at us.<br><br>It’s hard to capture the sheer complexity of what goes on behind the scenes. Our software team worked closely with every other sub-team—propulsion, avionics, structures—ensuring that all systems communicated seamlessly. We developed custom simulation tools to model and predict how ‘Borealis’ would perform under different scenarios. We built an intricate telemetry system that allowed us to track and visualize real-time data during the flight, giving us eyes in the sky as we monitored key metrics like altitude, speed, and orientation.</p><div><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z126ZESX3uA?si=A_UdD5JqDZl6PvIb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2 id="moments-of-triumph-and-challenge">Moments of Triumph and Challenge</h2><p>Of course, not everything went smoothly. There were moments of uncertainty, where weeks of work seemed on the brink of collapse. We experienced setbacks, debated over design decisions, and sometimes hit walls where progress felt like a distant dream. But what I’ll always remember is the team’s resilience—the way we pulled together, learned from each mistake, and kept moving forward.<br><br>I remember one particular afternoon vividly. We were conducting a static fire test, running our flight control software with the engine firing on the test stand. Everything looked perfect on paper, but as we initiated the test and ramped up the pressure of the fuel, unexpected oscillations began to appear. It was a tense moment—one of those “all hands on deck” situations. Yet, as we worked through the issue, tweaking parameters and debugging the pressure controls in real-time, we managed to identify the problem. After refining our code and verifying the fix, we saw the system stabilize and perform flawlessly. It was a huge relief and a testament to our team’s resilience and problem-solving skills.<br></p><div><div class="post__iframe"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZWvHEy1VRlg?si=3hFkXuVtqGbUqwnv&amp;start=12" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2 id="witnessing-the-launch-a-personal-milestone">Witnessing the Launch: A Personal Milestone</h2><p>Watching ‘Borealis’ lift off the ground, I felt a surge of pride and relief. For those few moments, as the rocket arched through the sky and the roar of the engines echoed across the field, time seemed to stand still. It was a culmination of not just my own work, but the collective effort of everyone on the team. This was our moment—a testament to what we can achieve when we bring our diverse talents and relentless passion together.<br><br>The successful launch of ‘Borealis’ is more than just a technical accomplishment for us; it’s a statement. It shows that a group of students, armed with nothing but knowledge, determination, and a shared dream, can push the boundaries of what’s possible in rocketry. This project positions the University of Waterloo among a select few institutions globally to have successfully launched a liquid-engine rocket, and I’m honored to have contributed to this legacy.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="./../media/posts/22/cover_home.png" height="2000" width="3000" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="./../media/posts/22/responsive/cover_home-xs.webp 300w, ./../media/posts/22/responsive/cover_home-sm.webp 480w, ./../media/posts/22/responsive/cover_home-md.webp 768w, ./../media/posts/22/responsive/cover_home-lg.webp 1024w, ./../media/posts/22/responsive/cover_home-xl.webp 1360w, ./../media/posts/22/responsive/cover_home-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><h2 id="whats-next-for-waterloo-rocketrylessbrgreater">What’s Next for Waterloo Rocketry?<br></h2><p>This is just the beginning. With the successful launch of ‘Borealis,’ our team is setting its sights even higher—literally and figuratively. As I step into the role of software project leader this year, I’m excited to push our team to reach even greater altitudes. We’re already planning our next project, aiming for larger rockets, more ambitious payloads, and even higher altitudes. Our focus will be on refining our liquid propulsion technology and taking on new challenges that test our engineering prowess and innovation.&nbsp;</p><p>If there’s one thing I’ve learned from this experience, it’s that the sky is not the limit—it’s just the beginning of the journey. I’m excited to keep pushing forward, both as a software engineer and as part of the incredible Waterloo Rocketry team. Stay tuned, because there’s much more to come!<br><br></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 7, 2024</p><div class="post__share-tag-container"></div></footer></article><div><strong>You should also read:</strong></div><div class="posts"><article><header><time datetime="2024-04-14T13:42" class="date">April 14, 2024</time><h2><a href="./../university-of-waterloo-mathematics/index.html">University of Waterloo (MATHEMATICS) 🙃🩷</a></h2></header><a href="./../university-of-waterloo-mathematics/index.html" class="image fit"><img src="./../media/posts/17/dji_fly_20230828_154416_13_1693251896657_photo.JPG" srcset="./../media/posts/17/responsive/dji_fly_20230828_154416_13_1693251896657_photo-xs.webp 300w, ./../media/posts/17/responsive/dji_fly_20230828_154416_13_1693251896657_photo-sm.webp 480w, ./../media/posts/17/responsive/dji_fly_20230828_154416_13_1693251896657_photo-md.webp 768w, ./../media/posts/17/responsive/dji_fly_20230828_154416_13_1693251896657_photo-lg.webp 1024w, ./../media/posts/17/responsive/dji_fly_20230828_154416_13_1693251896657_photo-xl.webp 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px" loading="lazy" height="3000" width="4000" alt=""></a><p></p><figure class="post__image align-center"><img loading="lazy" src="./../media/posts/17/IMG_6937.PNG" alt="" width="140" height="140" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="./../media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_6937-xs.webp 300w, ./../media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_6937-sm.webp 480w, ./../media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_6937-md.webp 768w, ./../media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_6937-lg.webp 1024w, ./../media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_6937-xl.webp 1360w, ./../media/posts/17/responsive/IMG_6937-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure><p>Embarking on the academic journey at the University of Waterloo as a Mathematics and Computer Science student has been nothing short of an exhilarating adventure.
